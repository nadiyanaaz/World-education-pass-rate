a. Introduction
This data contains information on the pass rates of Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exams by race and gender in the United States from 2002 to 2013. This data includes information on the number of schools offering AP Computer Science courses, the total number of students taking the exam, the number and percentage of students passing the exam, and the number and percentage of female, black, and Hispanic students passing the exam.   
 
b. The Dataset:
The dataset includes information on the number of schools offering AP Computer Science courses, the total number of students taking the exam, the number and percentage of students passing the exam, and the number and percentage of female, black, and Hispanic students passing the exam. The data is broken down by year, state, and exam type.
The dataset can be used to analyze trends in AP Computer Science participation and success rates by race and gender over time. It can also be used to compare the performance of different states

c. Summary:
I download the file from the GitHub repository and uploaded it to Google colab and start working on the duplicates and na values. I converted the columns according to the datatype and calculated the mean median and mode and detected the outliers with the help of a box plot.

I have used histograms,Scatter plot and bar graphs to show my analysis

h.Conclusion
I have explored my dataset and focused and uncovered a few columns to analyze to my understanding.I created a subset of Number of black students and define the outliers from the data by using the box plot.With the help of bar graph I showed Number of students have passed in Alabama state.I calculated the percentage value of Black students and showed it through bar graph.I found the correlation between Number of black students and Number of hispanic by creating Scatter plot.I calculated the mean of Number of black students  by the state through bar garph.

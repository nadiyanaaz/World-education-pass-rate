b. The Dataset:
The dataset includes information on the number of schools offering AP Computer Science courses, the total number of students taking the exam, the number and percentage of students passing the exam, and the number and percentage of female, black, and Hispanic students passing the exam. The data is broken down by year, state, and exam type.
The dataset can be used to analyze trends in AP Computer Science participation and success rates by race and gender over time. It can also be used to compare the performance of different states

c. Summary:
I download the file from the GitHub repository and uploaded it to Google colab and start working on the duplicates and na values. I converted the columns according to the datatype and calculated the mean median and mode and detected the outliers with the help of a box plot.
